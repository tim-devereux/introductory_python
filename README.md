## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Basic familiarity with using a computer

### Installation

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed):
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Or use package managers like `brew` (macOS) or `apt` (Ubuntu)

2. **Install Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

3. **Clone or download this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-notebooks
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

### Alternative Setup Options

- **Google Colab**: Upload notebooks to Google Colab for cloud-based learning
- **VS Code**: Use with the Jupyter extension for an integrated experience
- **Anaconda**: Install Anaconda distribution which includes Jupyter and common packages

## üìñ How to Use These Notebooks

### For Beginners
1. Start with **01_python_basics.ipynb** and work through each notebook sequentially
2. Run each code cell and experiment with the examples
3. Complete the practice exercises at the end of each notebook
4. Don't rush - take time to understand each concept before moving on

### For Intermediate Learners
1. Use as a reference guide for specific topics
2. Focus on notebooks covering areas you want to strengthen
3. Examine the real-world examples and adapt them to your projects
4. Challenge yourself with the advanced exercises

### Learning Tips
- **Run the code**: Execute every code cell to see the output
- **Experiment**: Modify the examples to see how changes affect the results
- **Practice**: Complete all exercises - they reinforce your learning
- **Debug**: If you encounter errors, use them as learning opportunities
- **Apply**: Try to apply concepts to your own projects

## üéØ Learning Objectives

After completing these notebooks, you will be able to:

- Write clean, readable Python code following best practices
- Use Python's built-in data structures effectively
- Handle files and exceptions properly
- Create and use functions and modules
